# Smarthome

The Smarthome project is a simulation of a house controlled by a computer.

Adults, children and animals live in the house. Everyday they use electronic devices.
When a device brakes down, an adult repairs it.

Every action is being logged to the log file.
At the end of a simulation reports are generated about the house: configuration, electricity consumeda and events that happen.
